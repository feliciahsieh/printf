Project name: printf

Description: At Holberton School we have the opportunity of creating our own printf() function. This is our first large project and will replicate the more common aspects of C's printf() function (without using the original printf()). A man page is available here. The following options are supported.

%c: character
%s: string
%%: percent
%d: integer
%i: integer
%b: binary
%u: unsigned integer
%o: octal
%x: hexadecimal (lower case)
%X: hexadecimal (upper case)
%r: reverse (partial implementation)
%R: Rot13 encryption (partial implementation)
